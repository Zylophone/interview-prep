Interview Preparation
=====================

I'm not that great at interviewing. I usually don't prep because I would like it
if I could be interviewed casually in my natural state and have my abilities
judged outside the interview by reviewing my work that's available online and
discussing it with me. Unfortunately that's wishful thinking because most
companies don't think like that. Hence this repository, to become better at
interviewing. With practice, this should be achievable.

This repository will contain a collection of useful resources to help you
prepare, such as coding questions, behavioural questions, resume tips, practice
tips, tips for phone and in-person interviews, and more.

### Attribution

The content in this repository is mainly a reflection of the book
[Cracking the Coding Interview][CtCI] by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
It's a fantastic prep resource and I recommend grabbing a copy.

I'll also be using resources from other places. Every file should have an
attribution comment, unless the content is original and created by me.
