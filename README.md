Interview Preparation
=====================

I'm not that great at interviewing. I usually don't prep because I would like it
if I could be interviewed in my natural state, and my abilities are judged by my
work that's available online. Unfortunately that's wishful thinking because most
companies don't think like that. Hence this repository, to become better at
interviewing. With practice, this should be achievable.

This repository will contain a collection of useful resources to help you
prepare, such as coding questions, behavioural questions, resume tips, practice
tips, tips for phone and in-person interviews, and more.
