Interview Preparation
=====================

I'm terrible at technical interviews. My anxiety levels skyrocket and I do
awful. I'm not a fan of the way technical interviews are performed, but it's
easier to change myself than change the way the industry does interviews.

This repository is an attempt to try and improve. Maybe it will help you too.

Coding questions, behavioural questions, resume tips, tips for phone and in-person interviews, etc.

Now if only I could follow my own advice.
