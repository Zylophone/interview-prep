Many tech companies will ask you to code something.

If the position you're applying to involves writing code and the interviewer(s)
do not ask you to code something _or_ do not look at any of your previous work,
consider that a big red flag.

Most companies will ask you to code something in real-time while observing you.
Some may have you tackle the problem individually, while others may have you pair
program with someone on the team. Such problems may be asked over a phone, if
you're lucky, you'll share an editor with the interviewer, otherwise have fun
describing your algorithm. If the interview is in person, it will likely be
a whiteboard coding problem.

Some companies will give you a "take home" coding problem. You'll have a limited
amount of time to solve the problem(s), typically a few days. In these
situations you can use whatever resources to solve the problem (e.g. access to
the internet and books are allowed). These problems tend to be slightly more
difficult than the problems in "real-time" interviews.

In real-time interviews, the goal is not to get the best answer.
The goal is to witness your thought process and decision making. They want to
see that you are smart, can write good code, and communicate technical concepts
clearly. It is crucial for success that you **communicate** while working on the
problem.

Questions are often intentionally underspecified, so you have to ask questions
before writing a solution. Never start writing code before asking questions.

Little details like syntax errors don't matter. Can't figure out if it's
`size()` or `length()`? Say you're unsure, choose one, describe what it does,
and move on.

Write good, clean, robust code and test it.

Interviewers expect real code. You can use pseudocode to start as long as you
tell your interviewer that you will write real code later.

Use a popular language. Don't use brainfuck, or prolog, or basic, or some other
language that most people have never used, unless you're going to be using that
language on the job. I personally prefer to use Python, but other popular
choices are Java, C++, C#, and JavaScript. Bonus points if you use a language
that you'll use on the job.
